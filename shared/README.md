# Shared Utilities for Backoffice Melano Inc

This directory contains utility functions that can be shared across different modules in the Backoffice Melano Inc project. These utilities are designed to promote code reusability and maintainability.

## Usage

To use the shared utilities in your module, you can import them as follows:

```javascript
import { utilityFunction } from '../shared/utils';
```

## Guidelines

- Ensure that utility functions are generic and reusable across multiple modules.
- Document each utility function in `utils.js` to provide clear usage instructions.
- Keep the utilities organized and avoid adding module-specific logic to this directory.

## Contributing

If you wish to add new utilities or modify existing ones, please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main project README.
